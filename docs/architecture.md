# Cashflow Tracker Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Cashflow Tracker system, including its components, data flow, and design principles.

## System Overview

The Cashflow Tracker is designed as a modular Python application that follows functional programming principles. The system consists of several interconnected components organized in a layered architecture:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Handles importing data from various sources
2. **Data Processing Layer**: Cleans, normalizes, and categorizes data
3. **Analysis Layer**: Aggregates and calculates financial metrics
4. **Output Generation Layer**: Creates visualizations and exports data

## Components and Structure

### Core Components

- **Schema Definitions**: Data structures that define the format of transactions and categories
- **Ingestion Functions**: Components for importing data from various sources (CSV, Excel, manual entry)
- **Processing Functions**: Components for cleaning, normalizing, and categorizing transactions
- **Aggregation Functions**: Components for summarizing data in various ways
- **Calculation Functions**: Components for deriving financial metrics
- **Output Generation**: Components for creating Excel workbooks, charts, and visualizations

## Data Flow

The Cashflow Tracker implements a functional data processing pipeline where data flows through several transformation steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Import from CSV/Excel files or manual entry
   - Map to standard schema structure

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Normalize date formats
   - Standardize transaction types
   - Ensure consistent data types

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Categorize transactions based on rules
   - Extract producer/vendor information
   - Organize into structured format

4. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Group by category, producer, time period
   - Calculate summary statistics

5. **Financial Calculations**:
   - Calculate net cashflow
   - Determine cash allocation (spending/saving/investing)
   - Compare against budgets

6. **Output Generation**:
   - Create formatted Excel workbooks
   - Generate visualizations
   - Export processed data

## Design Principles

The Cashflow Tracker is built on the following design principles:

### 1. Modularity

Each component has a single responsibility, making the system easier to maintain and extend. New functionality can be added without affecting existing components.

### 2. Functional Programming

The system uses pure functions that transform data without side effects. This makes the code easier to test, reason about, and debug.

### 3. Data Immutability

Data is treated as immutable, with each transformation creating a new copy rather than modifying the original.

### 4. Separation of Concerns

Clear separation between data structures, processing logic, and presentation.

### 5. Extensibility

The system is designed to be easily extended with new features, such as:
- Additional data sources
- New categorization rules
- Different visualization types
- Enhanced financial calculations

## Data Structures

### TransactionSchema

The core data structure for individual financial transactions:

```python
class TransactionSchema:
    DATE = 'Date'
    DESCRIPTION = 'Description'
    AMOUNT = 'Amount'
    TYPE = 'Type'           # Income/Expense
    CATEGORY = 'Category'
    SUBCATEGORY = 'Subcategory'
    PRODUCER = 'Producer/Vendor'
    PAYMENT_METHOD = 'Payment Method'
    NOTES = 'Notes'
```

### CategorySchema

The structure for category definitions and budgets:

```python
class CategorySchema:
    MAIN_CATEGORY = 'Main Category'
    SUBCATEGORY = 'Subcategory'
    DESCRIPTION = 'Description'
    BUDGET = 'Budget Amount'
```

```

## Extension Points

The Cashflow Tracker can be extended in several ways:

### 1. Data Sources

Add new data ingestion functions in `ingestion.py` for different sources:
- Bank API integration
- Mobile app integration
- PDF statement parsing

### 2. Categorization Rules

Extend the categorization system in `processing.py`:
- Machine learning-based categorization
- Natural language processing for descriptions
- User-defined custom rules

### 3. Visualizations

Add new visualization types in `visualizations.py`:
- Interactive charts
- Geographic spending maps
- Trend analysis visualizations

### 4. Financial Analysis

Enhance the financial calculations in `calculation.py`:
- Forecasting and projections
- Budget optimization
- Financial goal tracking

## Performance Considerations

The system is designed for personal finance scale (thousands of transactions), not enterprise scale (millions of transactions). For larger datasets, consider:

1. Implementing database storage
2. Adding pagination for large datasets
3. Using more efficient data structures for aggregation
4. Implementing caching for commonly accessed data

## Future Architecture Evolution

As the system grows, potential architectural changes might include:

1. Moving to a layered architecture with clearer separation between:
   - Data access layer
   - Business logic layer
   - Presentation layer

2. Implementing a command pattern for operations

3. Adding an event system for notifications

4. Developing a plugin architecture for extensions
